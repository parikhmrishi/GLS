            â€¢ The fifth and final barrier presented by Beckford (1998) is the
            costs of quality. Costs of quality can be divided into two
            categories; direct costs and invisible costs. Direct costs are costs
            that arise from not achieving quality and are attributes visible to
            the organization.Invisible costs are costs that arise when the
            organization are not achieving quality but cannot be seen by the
            organization. Direct costs can be products with errors that require
            rework and rectification. Invisible costs can be dissatisfied
            customers who move to a competitor for an alternative
            product/service.
