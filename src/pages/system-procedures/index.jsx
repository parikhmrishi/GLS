            The first barrier is systems and procedures, which may inhibit the
            pursuit of quality due to the fact that most organizations have long
            established processes and organizational systems with a certain
            bureaucratic process. When adding a new organizational system, such
            as the QMS, organizations have to change or adapt their original
            systems and procedures to the new one. It is likely that the
            original systems and procedures will conflict with the new ones as
            QMS implies standardized procedures. This means that when
            introducing new requirements for specific procedures the pressure
            for change and adaptation may cause resistance from those in charge
            of the procedures.
