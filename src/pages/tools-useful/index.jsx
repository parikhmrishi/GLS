            Flowcharts Flowcharts show the logical steps in a process and how
            various elements within a system are related. They can be used to
            determine and analyze potential problems in quality planning and
            quality control. The system, or process, flowchart is probably the
            one that people are most familiar with according to the survey. This
            type of flowchart outlines the logical steps to complete a process.
            By documenting these logical steps, the team can identify where
            quality problems might occur and then develop approaches to
            proactively manage them. Flowcharting also helps create a process
            that is repeatable.
